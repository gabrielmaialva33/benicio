# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is an AdonisJS 7, React 19, and Inertia application. Backend features live in `app/modules/<domain>/`; each domain
owns its controllers, services, repositories, models, validators, and `routes.ts`. Put cross-cutting middleware, JWT
support, base Lucid classes, and shared services in `app/shared/`, and typed errors in `app/exceptions/`.

Frontend pages, layouts, components, hooks, and styles live under `inertia/`. Database migrations, factories, and
seeders are in `database/`; server-rendered views and translations are in `resources/`. Backend tests mirror their suite
under `tests/{unit,functional,browser}/`, while frontend tests live in `inertia/tests/`.

Adonis generators target the framework's default layout, which this repository does not use. If you run
`pnpm ace make:*`, move generated code into the owning module and replace default aliases with `#modules/*`,
`#shared/*`, or another alias declared in `package.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` installs the locked dependency graph using pnpm.
- `pnpm dev` starts the application and Vite with HMR; PostgreSQL and Redis must be available.
- `pnpm ace migration:run` applies pending migrations; `pnpm ace db:seed` loads seed data.
- `pnpm build` creates the production backend and frontend bundles.
- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` checks both TypeScript projects and ESLint rules.
- `pnpm test:e2e && pnpm test:ui` runs all Japa suites, then Vitest. Use `pnpm test` for backend unit tests only.

Use Node 24 from `.nvmrc`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development; never commit real credentials.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

TypeScript is strict. Use two-space indentation, LF endings, snake_case filenames, PascalCase classes and React
components, and camelCase functions and variables. Run `pnpm format` (Prettier) and `pnpm lint` before submitting.
Follow neighboring modules instead of introducing a new layering pattern. Do not restore removed aliases such as
`#controllers/*` or `#models/*`.

### Backend dependency rule

Keep the dependency direction `Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Model/Database`. Controllers handle HTTP input and
responses; services own business orchestration and use `UnitOfWork` for cross-repository transactions; repositories are
the only application layer allowed to execute Lucid/SQL queries or relationship persistence. Controllers and middleware
must not import repositories directly. These boundaries are enforced in
`eslint.config.js`; add an intent-named repository method instead of disabling the rule.

## Testing Guidelines

Japa backend tests use `*.spec.ts`; Vitest/Testing Library frontend tests use `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.tsx`. Add
regression coverage in the closest matching suite. Tests migrate and seed the database automatically from `.env.test`;
browser tests require Playwright Chromium. No coverage threshold is enforced, but changed behavior should be exercised.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History follows Conventional Commits, usually with scopes: `feat(ui): ...`, `fix(auth): ...`, `refactor(jwt): ...`, or
`chore(ci): ...`. Keep commits focused and imperative. Pull requests should explain impact, link relevant issues, call
out migrations or environment changes, include screenshots for UI work, and report results for lint, typecheck, tests,
and build.
